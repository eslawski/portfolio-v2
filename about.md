My name is Evan and I am Software Developer. I graduated from the University of Michigan, and have
the privilege of working in the great city of Ann Arbor.
 My wife, Katie, and I currently live in Dexter, MI where we enjoy exploring the outdoors.

I set out to create this blog with the intention of documenting our adventures. Thanks for stopping by to check
it out!

Cheers! üçª
