- Create post file
	- Copy and paste an old one
	- Change numbers
	- Make folder for images corresponding to the post number

- Rename images by numbering them
- Rotate images as needed
- Place original images in new image directory just in case

- Pick out a hero/entry image
	- Scale down to 400 X 600ish (15% for landscape pixel photos @ 80% quality)
	- Rename and put this image in new image directory you just created and reference in front matter
	- Go to this directory: C:\Users\Evan\go\bin
	- Place the image in that directory too (haven't setup environment variable yet)
	- Run: primitive -i entry_1.jpg -o entry_1_primitive.svg -n 200
	- Take that svg and run it through base64 image encoder
	- This becomes the 'thumbnail' in the front matter
	- Take original quality photo and create hero image (30% scale @ 90% quality)
	- Rename and put this image in new image directory you just created and reference in front matter

- Optimize the rest of the images you want to include in post
	- Go to https://bulkresizephotos.com/
	- Low Res images 15% @ 80% quality
	- High Res images 50% @ 80% quality

- Write that blog!
- Look at examples for image grids, panoramic pictures, videos, etc.

- To view all the performance_testing blogs you just need to change the is_debug flag in _config.ymal

Running Jekyll:
	bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0
	NOTE: Must always restart this after changing _config.ymal

TODO later:
- Make back button press close image modals
- Add other sections to the site
- Fixup about picture
- Weird issue on chrome for iphone that changes viewport height and causes glitchy images sometimes
- Add categories to blog posts and allow for filtering
- Change up about section photo to maybe use primitive too
- Optimize images further
	- Use webp images with fallbacks
	- Use srcset to grab different images depending on the device size
	- Images in 'Additional Images' section really don't need to be that big
- Clean up
	- Reorganize scss more logically
	- Remove performance testing code
	- Reorganize html template files
	- Bring together responsive image background and progressive loader.
	    - Beware of transition glitchiness that comes with animating the background image though.
