Katie and I got to experience some of the most beautiful scenery this area has to offer. The last couple days in Vegas have been fun, but we are ready to come home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting off the morning we went to the Wicked Spoon buffet which was located in our hotel. It is supposedly the top rated buffet in Vegas, and I can see why. When I booked the hotel they actually included two buffets for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food was quite amazing. It was only 9:30am and they had everything from breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was spent lounging around at all of the three pools available in our hotel. It was a much needed relaxation day after our non-stop vacation mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around dinner time we wanted to find somewhere to watch the Thursday Night Football game. We landed on Beer Park which is a rooftop bar outside the Paris hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a bit of shock coming back to busy highways, flashing lights, slot machines, and people everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned in our rental car and caught a Lyft to our hotel. We are staying at the Cosmopolitan right on the stip. We splurged a bit on this hotel, but we are glad we did because it is really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our room is by far the best room hotel room I ever stayed in. At 600 sq/ft it is almost as big as some of the apartments I have rented in the past. When we were checking in, the front desk attendant was trying to get us to upgrade to a master suite which was 1600 sq/ft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our room was on the 32nd floor, which is really only about half way. The room itself had an ipad fixed to the wall where you could control temperature, see the weather, turn on/off the lights, and even order room service. We also have a balcony which looks right out onto the strip. When we got there we enjoyed a few brews and some views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then ventured out into the wild, and headed to the High Roller. The High Roller is essentially a pod-like ferris wheel that takes you high above the strip. Of course some of the pods are equipped with a bar, so we opted for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was about 10 people in our pod. It took 30 minutes to complete one revolution, and the best part was it was all you can drink. Obviously, we took full advantage of that. The entire time I also setup the GoPro to try a timelapse. The sun’s positioning and glare made it a bit difficult to capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_Vh1E8xcuY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bartender gave us a heads up about 2 minutes before the end. She said it was last call and we were more than welcome to top off and take a drink for the road (legal in Vegas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katie and I were feeling pretty good by the end, so went to go grab some food at a nearby restaurant that our Lyft driver had recommended. The place was called Yard House. They claimed to have the most draft beers on tap in the world (145 taps). Their food was probably the best we had our entire trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point it was about 6:00pm and Katie and I were dead tired. Our bodies were used to getting up at 6:00am to go hiking. We went back to our hotel room and took a two hour nap in preparation for the nightlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had reservations at The Chandelier lounge for 9:30pm. The Chandelier is a giant 3 story centerpiece of the Cosmopolitan hotel. Each level has a bar with it’s own view. We opted for the middle level which puts your right inside the chandelier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap &quot; data-responsive-background-image=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first drink our waitress recommended was one off their secret menu called the Verbena. The drink was very similar to a margarita, but it came with this special edible flower. The waitress instructed us to take a sip of the drink, chew the flower for 20 seconds, and then see how the flavor of the drink changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standalone-blog-image image-wrap  &quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap &quot; data-responsive-background-image=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the flower was from a plant known as the Toothache Plant. It supposedly cleanses your palate by killing any bacteria in our mouth while activating your salivary glands. As were were chewing on the flower our mouths began to tingle, like eating a bunch of pop rocks. Our mouths also began to water like when you are about to eat some tasty. We took a sip of the drink again and noticed how the flavors slightly changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we took a stroll over the Bellagio to go check out the fountains and the inside of the hotel. At that point it was about midnight and the city was still just as busy as it was all day.&lt;/p&gt;

We booked a full day guided expedition with the Zion Adventure Company. Our guide, Stephen, was a young guy from Arizona who loved to climb and explore the outdoors. It was pretty cool because nobody else booked a canyoneering trip for that day, so it was just Katie and I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen gave us the choice between two canyons. Both of them were rated 3 (out of 4) in terms of difficulty. For reference, the narrows is only rated a 1. The first option was a wet canyon, which meant there would be sections where we would have to wade through water. The second option was dry canyon with longer rappels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went with the wet canyon option. Who doesn’t want to get a little wet? The name of the canyon was called “Yankee Doodle” located in Leeds, UT. Stephen hooked us up with all the canyoneering gear we would need including a helmet, a harness, a “skuttlebutt”, a dry bag, and some fancy canyoneering shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From their headquarters we had about an hour drive to the canyon. Half of that hour was spent on a one lane dirt road carving up and down the backcountry. We finally got there and Stephen gave us a full lesson on how we will be using all the gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fglRX2n7OY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enter the canyon we needed to do a short rappel in. Katie went first. It was a pretty weird feeling to just walk backwards over the edge of a cliff trusting your life in a long rope. Being semi afraid of heights I thought we did pretty well for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly approached the second rappel, and it dwarfed the first one. Stephen fixed the rope to the anchor and threw the slack to the bottom. It sounded like it fell for a least 5 second to the bottom. This rappel had some interesting angles, so we couldn’t really see the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I went first. Stephen did a great job directing us down, as he was pretty much dangling off the edge (with a safety harness). Once I got to the bottom I managed to get some good footage of Katie coming down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ScN4zhRGHzg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the rappels we had to do some down climbing. This pretty much involved finding creative ways to apply pressure to the walls and rocks to lower yourself to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then started to hit the wet sections. The first part was probably only up to our ankles, but the second part got up as high as our waist. It was pretty freaky taking a step into murky water that you had no idea how deep it actually was. Stephen was very surprised how low the water level was. He was saying how some parts usually required a swim to get to the other side!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About midway through we ate some lunch surrounded by canyon. The entire day we didn’t see a single person despite the destination being a popular choice for canyoneering adventure companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting pictures in the canyon was pretty difficult because it involved being “hands free” a lot. Stephen actually had a waterproof camera that he was using to get pictures of us in action. I also had my gopro mounted to my helmet. Unfortunately the footage wasn’t so great because we had it tilted down a little too much, but we captured some good moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some more rappelling, downclimbing, wading through water, and sliding on our skuttlebutts we were at the out-point. This was where we had to do a little bit of basic free climbing. Once we got to the top, our car was surprisingly right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total length of the canyon we did was approximately 1.5 miles. Would we ever go again? Yes absolutely! It was TON of fun getting exposed to so many techniques used to explore slot canyons. I cannot imagine how insane it must be to do some of the longer rappels that get up to 300 ft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived back at headquarters and said goodbye to our awesome guide Stephen. I would highly recommend Stephen H. and the Zion Adventure Company to anyone else interested in canyoneering adventure in Zion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we hit up Oscar’s Cafe for dinner as suggested by Stephen. It surely did not disappoint. Their portion sizes are amazingly huge, and the food was delicious. We also ordered a pitcher of beer, and it came in an urn. It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

We woke up super early in order to get to Zion National Park in time for a parking spot. The plan was to hike the historic “Narrows”. This hike pretty much involves trudging through ankle to waist deep water while being surrounded by giant slot canyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standalone-blog-image image-wrap  &quot;&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped by the Visitors Center first to see what sort of gear they would recommend. To our surprise they pretty much said just to go in our hiking boots equipped with some wool socks. Another critical recommendation they made was a walking stick. Walking through the Narrows can be very unstable. Some sections have small rapids and slippery rocks that lurk underneath (just ask Katie).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rented some walking sticks from one of the nearby outfitter shops and hopped on a shuttle. The Narrows is the last shuttle stop on the line (roughly 40 minutes). To break that up, we got off about halfway at the Zion Lodge. Located here is the Emerald Pools trailhead, which was a quick 1.2 mile hike to the “lower” pools. There is also a “middle” and “upper” pool which we really wanted to see, but again these trails were closed indefinitely due to landslides a few months back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hopped back on the shuttle, and continued on to the Narrows. Once we got there, we had a 1 mile walk on a paved path to the Virgin River where we would be hiking. When we finally got there, we geared up our equipment and took that first step into the cold water. It was certainly a weird feeling at first, but we quickly got used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 80% of the hike involves actually walking through water. The rest of the time there are rocky banks that you can portage around some of the difficult sections. We were lucky enough to also have good weather to do this hike. Flash floods are a real threat in this canyon. The ranger was saying they can even be powerful enough to move large boulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hike itself is unlike any other. The entire time you are walking between two walls with absolutely no escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked for about 2 miles up the canyon, and reached the “Wall Street” section. Here, in some areas the slot narrows to as little as 22 ft and the canyon walls
 soar as high as 1500 ft. It was truly an awesome experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked for about another half mile and turned around. Sometime along the way we had run into a group of overnight hikers equipped with massive bags. Apparently they were on a multi day trip down the canyon. They had all their overnight gear along with ropes for rappelling. Not sure I would want to be soggy for that many days, but I thought it was neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we had gotten back to the shuttles we had hiked a total of 6 miles over the course of about 5 hours. We both were quite exhausted and could not wait to get back to our hotel for nice hot tub soak.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today started off similar to yesterday.

Today adds yet another to our story together. We got to hike to one of the most beautiful lookouts at Zion National Park (Observation Point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking at Zion, is extremely competitive. It usually runs out of it’s 450 parking spots by 8:00am, so we knew we had to get there early. Our hotel is about 30 minutes from the park, so we got an early head start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in the park you are required to take shuttles everywhere. At this point in the morning there is quite a line for outbound shuttles. From the time we parked to when we actually got to the trailhead, an hour had gone by. If we were to do it all again, we probably wouldn’t have gotten a hotel so far away, and instead paid the bucko-bucks to stay in Springdale, UT (right outside the park).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big trail for the day was called Observation Point. It was an 8 mile round trip hike climbing 2100 ft. We decided on this hike because it supposedly offers the best views of the park, and it is not nearly as busy as the popular Angel’s Landing hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t make it up the full 4 miles, there are still some incredible views to be had all along this hike showcasing many different areas of the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got to the top the views were truly incredible. You could see the road winding around the park through the mountains as far as the eye can see. We could also even see people hiking the dangerous Angel’s Landing hike out in the distance. We took loads of pictures so be sure to check them out at the very end too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying some lunch at the top we began our descent down. At the bottom we made a slight detour to check out the Weeping Rock. We would have also checked out the Hidden Canyon, but that trail was closed due to damage caused by a rainstorm from over a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the day by hitting up the Zion Brewing Company. The best part was this little brewery sat right outside the park entrance, so we just walked right over.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Two years ago I married my best friend, and it has been full of adventures.

We checked out of our cabin and hit the road headed to Zion National Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we left, we decided to hit up one more quick hike as it was on the way. It was called Mossy Cave, and it was only 0.8 miles. This little trek proved to be well worth it. We got to see a waterfall nestled within the Bryce Canyon scenery, as well as a cave covered in moss. Apparently these are both great sights to see in the winter months too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive to Zion was about 3 hours. In order to get to our hotel we had to actually travel through the park. Words cannot explain how epically beautiful this drive was. I managed to get more video footage with our makeshift gopro car mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We packed up our hiking bags and lunches then headed for Bryce Canyon. Since we didn’t get a picture at the sign yesterday, we stopped off on our way into the park. There we ran into a couple wearing some U of M gear. Turns out they graduated from U of M, so we bonded over how awesome Ann Arbor is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our plan was to hike the “Figure 8 Trail” which consists of three smaller hikes: Queens Garden, Peek-a-Boo Loop, and Navajo Loop. We started at Sunrise Point and headed down the Queens Garden to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty steep descent since we were going from the rim to the bottom of the canyon. We got about a 1 mile in and we were presented with this sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew we were trying to make it to the Peek-a-Boo trail, so naturally we followed that. We probably hiked for another mile and were a little concerned we hadn’t seen any other hikers, just people on horseback. Turns out we somehow ended up on the horse trails. Which explains why everything smelled like horse poop. We quickly double-backed and made it back to the hiking trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up going back to the sign that pointed us to the “Peek-a-Boo Loop”. You would think this would actually be the Peek-a-Boo Loop. Nope. It is a horse trail that is a cut off to the Peek-a-Boo. When you get to the bottom there is a fork in the road. One path has a sign with a picture of a horse, the other has nothing. Well we knew we didn’t want to end up on horse trail so we figured we should take the one without the horse. Wrong again. Apparently they were both horse trails, and we should have picked the other path to hit our cut off. Funny thing was we were not the only people to do this today. We ran into two other hiking groups who made this same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally got on course, but had already hiked 2 miles more than we had planned for the day. The Peek-a-Book trail was actually really cool. You got to get up close and personal with the Hoodoos. One of the majors features of the “Wall of Windows”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiking so close to the Hoodoos we got to see how interesting these formations really are. They are almost like totem poles, but just made out of rock. You wonder how some of them are still standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we were done hiking the loop we had to make the difficult trek up the Navajo Trail to Sunset Point. At that point we felt like we pretty much hiked all of Bryce Canyon. We caught a bus back to our car and headed into town for dinner to replenish our calories.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today we had a full day dedicated to hiking Bryce Canyon. We woke up around 7:15am which was sleeping in for us thus far. Our cabin lacked coffee, so we walked across the street to a great little local coffee shop. They also had reliable wifi, which is a rarity in the valley, so I was able to finish up yesterday’s blog.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bryce Canyon</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/20/bryce-canyon.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bryce Canyon" /><published>2018-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/09/20/bryce-canyon</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/20/bryce-canyon.html">&lt;p&gt;Today we said goodbye to Lake Powell and headed to Bryce Canyon. We left late morning and it was about a three hour drive which consisted of a total of 3 turns. The drive itself was again beautiful through some remote parts of Arizona and into Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got close to Bryce Canyon, we pulled off on the side of the road. I had rigged up a car mount for the gopro using one of those industrial strength suction cups. I suctioned it to the hood of our car and we drove down into the valley where we were staying.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in Tropic, UT where we were staying. We are renting a cabin for a couple nights. It practically has the same amenities as a hotel room, just with our own individual unit. Though there is wifi, but it doesn’t quite have the firepower we need to backup all our videos. So check back soon for video footage later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that time it was late afternoon, so we decided to go quickly checkout the vistas at Bryce Canyon. Parking was pretty limited so we had to take shuttles around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop was Bryce Point. This lookout was the first glimpse we got of this unique canyon made of “hoodoos”. They look like those drippy sand castles you used to make at the beach when you were a little kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then walked around the Rim Trail all the way to Inspiration Point. In my opinion, these are where the best views were. Off in the distance we could actually see the small town of Tropic where we were staying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the day by grabbing dinner at a place within walking distance of our cabin. The place was an old barn converted into a restaurant that played live country music.&lt;/p&gt;

We ended up renting some paddleboards for cheap at Lake Powell Paddleboards, and they were really great. They set us up with all the gear, mounted everything on our rental car, and even gave us a beginner’s paddleboard lesson since we had never been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy who worked with us was also from Michigan, so we exchanged stories. He gave us some pretty detailed directions on where to go for the best routes. He suggested that we go back into the Antelope Canyon area. There they had a massive boat launch that had to have been two football fields long. We drove down, dropped off the boards, parked, and we walked back down to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katie and I are seasoned kayakers, but have never been paddleboarding. It was a bit awkward at first, but I think we got the hang of it pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lake Powell itself is wild. It is pretty much just a canyon that is filled with beautiful blue/green water. Since it is a canyon it drops off FAST. We pushed off from the shoreline and within a couple strokes we could not see the bottom. The guy at the paddleboard shop was saying that it can easily get to 400-500 ft deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the trip was through a larger section of the canyon. It was fairly wide so boats were allowed to go fast, and we were battling their wake at times. After that though we got into the canyon section, a no wake zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standalone-blog-image image-wrap  &quot;&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was what we had come here for. We paddled through the canyon, and on either side of us were rock walls. There might have been a handful of very small “beaches” where you could get off and take a break, but other than that the towering walls extended deep into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to get good pictures with being on the water and all, but I had the gopro head mount rigged up to get some amateur video footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point along the canyon the water eventually stops. Here we got off our boards and got to go hike the rest of it on foot. The hike started with a canyon similar in width to what we had just paddleboarded. However, about a mile in, the canyon narrowed drastically and got to the point where we were ducking under formations carved out by the water that used to flow there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a mile and a half in, we hit our turn around spot. We ate some lunch in the middle of the canyon, said “hi” to some of the lizards, and turned back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the paddleboard trip was rough. Though it never actually rained, dark clouds started to move in, and the wind picked up. There was some pretty gnarly wake that make it difficult stand on the board for noobs like us. Luckily we were with the wind so we hardly had to paddle to get back to our take-out point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After paddleboarding we wanted to grab dinner somewhere on the water. Turns out right around the corner was the Antelope Point Marina. This marina is practically its own floating concrete island. I would estimate there were probably about 100 houseboats docked, and 30 different golf carts/gators zooming around transporting people/luggage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man-made island was also stocked with a liquor store, ice cream shop, and restaurant. Katie and I ate some dinner at the restaurant outside and watched the sunset. They were playing early 2000’s hits, and they were hitting the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

Katie and I pretty much limped down to breakfast after rolling out of bed. Once we started moving though things were feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pretty much had the whole day to do some touristy sightseeing. Page itself is a pretty neat city. Everything was less than a 5 minute drive from our hotel.  It essentially is surrounded by nothing but desert, but provides access to the beautiful blue waters of Lake Powell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First stop of the day was Horseshoe Bend. The parking was very limited, but we got lucky and snagged a spot. It’s probably about a half mile walk to the bend. When we arrived there was a least a couple hundred people there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standalone-blog-image image-wrap   pano&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap &quot; data-responsive-background-image=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bend itself is massive. I have seen many pictures before, but nothing compares to experiencing this in person. If you can see in the image above there is a white spec at the bottom. That is a boat. It helps give some scale as to how massive this bend actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty freaky because there are no real safety barriers protecting tourists from falling hundreds of feet to the bottom. The foreign tourists were making us really nervous climbing out to the cliffs while wearing flip-flops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we went to go check out the Glen Dam. It sits on the Colorado River just before Lake Powell and spans the entire canyon. We got to walk across the bridge and also enjoyed some sweet views from the visitors center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we headed to our tour of the Lower Antelope Canyons. These slot canyons sit on Navajo land and you must book a guided tour in order to see them. As we expected, there were tons of tourists. I think we were the only one from the states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tour was the last one at the day starting at 4:15pm. There was a group of about 20 of us along with our guide. The tour started at the deepest section of the canyon and we worked our way up. To get to the bottom they had metal staircases in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got to the bottom it was pretty spectacular. Everywhere you looked was like a Windows screen saver. Our guide was also awesome. He pretty much took everyone’s phone and hooked us up with the ideal camera settings for taking pictures in the canyon. He knew where every photo op spot was and had a system for getting individual shots for all of our group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canyon itself is really cool. There are so many different features along the slot. Apparently quite a bit of maintenance goes into making the slot canyon available for tourists. Our guide was saying that about 10 to 20 times a year the canyon will flood, and they have to go down and clean it out. It pretty much involves going down with buckets and pushing the water down the slot. After that they dump large amounts of sand from the top so it is easy for tourists to walk on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently if we had been on a tour from 10:00am to 1:00pm we would have seen the light beams that shine down from the top. Our guide showed us a video though. They basically take a handful of dirt and throw it up in the air. As it settles, you can see a gleaming beam of light shining down from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got out of the canyon we looked back at where we had come from. You could hardly tell there was anything there at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end the day we had some dinner at Big John’s BBQ. They had outdoor seating at live country music everyday at 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;
